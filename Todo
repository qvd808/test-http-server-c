1. Create a socket and accept connection
2. Write a program that accepts a connection on a specific port, send 
back HTTP 1.0
3. Modify program to parse request
4. Modify program to take another command line argument for "root" 
directory
5. Modify your program to take another command line argument for 
the "root" directory. Make a directory somewhere, and put a 
dummy HTML file called index.html and another dummy HTML
 file called whatever you want. Add a dummy image file as well.
  When your server starts up, verify that the folder exists 
  and that your program has permissions to view the contents. 
 Modify your program to parse the path from valid GET requests.
 Upon parsing the path, check the root folder to see if a file 
 matches that filename. If so, respond 200, read the file and
 write the file to the client socket. If the path is "/"
 (ie. the root directory) serve index.html. If the requested
  file does not exist, respond 404 not found. 
  Make sure your solution works for text files as well as binaries 
  (ie. images).

6. Add folder. Improve path-prsing logic
7. Modify permission on a few dummy folders to make their read
permission to the server program
